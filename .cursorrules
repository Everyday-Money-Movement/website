project_name: Everyday Money Movement
goals:
  - Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
  - Blog + MDX + multi-author front-matter
  - "Live on Bitcoin" interactive map â†’ /live/[country]
  - Keep shadcndesign Pro Blocks SOURCE out of public repo
guardrails:
  - Do not copy any code from packages/pro-blocks into the public repo
  - Use default shadcn tokens; no custom brand tokens yet
  - No analytics, no external scripts
  - A11y: keyboard focus, aria labels; respect prefers-reduced-motion
conventions:
  - Content in /content/{blog|countries}; authors in /content/authors
  - Flat blog slugs: /blog/slug
  - Use existing file tree; keep components small and composable
tasks:
  - Wire MDX loaders and blog index
  - Build /live map with react-simple-maps + world-atlas
  - Add 5 country pages (PL, US, DE, SV, CR)
  - Create CI workflow (typecheck + build)
notes:
  - If unsure, propose a plan before modifying many files
  - Prefer shadcn/ui primitives; keep classNames minimal
