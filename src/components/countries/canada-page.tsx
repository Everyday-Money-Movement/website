          Buying and selling Bitcoin directly is common in the active Bitcoin communities of large cities in Canada. Apps are rarely used as buyers and sellers coordinate directly. You may find the contacts of your local Bitcoin meetup to be helpful.

          The Canadian gift card economy is well developed and most gift cards are sold for Bitcoin, occasionally at a small discount. For groceries, online shopping, petrol and large retailers, gift cards are a convenient way to spend Bitcoin.

          While proper Bitcoin exchanges are rare in Canada, there are plenty of reputable online brokers that can be used to pay bills or make wire transfers for Bitcoin, even to accounts not in your name. This can be useful when paying invoices, purchasing expensive goods or paying rent.
