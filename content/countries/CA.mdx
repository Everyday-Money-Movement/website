# Live on Bitcoin in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

Your all-around info about living on Bitcoin in Canada.

## General Info

Living on Bitcoin in Canada is increasingly easy with growing merchant adoption, a lively Bitcoin community and improving integration with existing payment systems.

## Merchants

Especially Western Canada is seeing accelerating merchant adoption, allowing you to spend your Bitcoin directly at grocers, butchers, restaurants and other service providers.

## Over the Counter

Currency exchanges that buy Bitcoin for cash exist but are not widespread and may charge high fees.

## Peer to Peer

Buying and selling Bitcoin directly is common in the active Bitcoin communities of large cities in Canada. Apps are rarely used as buyers and sellers coordinate directly. You may find the contacts of your local Bitcoin meetup to be helpful.

## ATMs

ATMs are widespread but rarely dispense cash. They almost always charge prohibitive fees.

## Gift cards

The Canadian gift card economy is well developed and most gift cards are sold for Bitcoin, occasionally at a small discount. For groceries, online shopping, petrol and large retailers, gift cards are a convenient way to spend Bitcoin.

## Debit cards

Reloadable and one-time Prepaid debit cards are common and convenient. Reloadable cards typically require a verified account, while non-reloadable cards don't.

## Brokers and Exchanges

While proper Bitcoin exchanges are rare in Canada, there are plenty of reputable online brokers that can be used to pay bills or make wire transfers for Bitcoin, even to accounts not in your name. This can be useful when paying invoices, purchasing expensive goods or paying rent.
