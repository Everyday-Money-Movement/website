# Live on Bitcoin in Hong Kong ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°

Your all-around info about living on Bitcoin in Hong Kong.

## General Info

Living on Bitcoin in Hong Kong is difficult as there are very few merchants accepting Lightning payments.

## Over the Counter

However, selling Bitcoin for cash is convenient at the many in-person exchange kiosks that exist throughout the city. Some companies will even accept Lightning deposits and cash out in Hong Kong Dollars, US dollars or Renminbi immediately.

## Peer to Peer

There is a small but robust peer-to-peer trading scene. Approach the Hong Kong Bitcoin Meetup for contacts and details. Trades are commonly conducted through cash deposits at ATMs or FPS transactions.

## ATMs

Bitcoin ATMs are widespread but rarely dispense cash. They typically charge high fees.

## Gift cards

The gift card economy is not strongly developed in Hong Kong, and gift cards sold for Bitcoin are uncommon.

## Debit cards

Hong Kong Dollar denominated debit cards are not currently issued. USD denominated cards typically work in the city, including prepaid debit cards.

## Exchanges

Licensed local exchanges can deposit Hong Kong Dollars into local bank accounts reliably. Transfers from international exchanges are occasionally blocked by Hong Kong banks.
